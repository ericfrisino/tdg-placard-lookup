# TDG Placard Lookup - WordPress Plugin

## Description & Usage
This plugin uses [data published by Open Canada] (https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/197260f1-b5dc-4f53-a036-2541cff379eb) to search for chemical classification and other related information by the chemical's UN Number.


This plugin creates a form anywhere on your website using the shortcode `[tdg_placard_lookup /]`

Originally created for http://tdgplacards.ca as a sales tool on a landing site for customers to interact with and find out what placard they need to order.

## Future to-dos
- Implement automatic upgrade routine for the database when Open Canada updates their data.
- Implement deletion routine when the plugin is deleted through the plugin menu interface.
